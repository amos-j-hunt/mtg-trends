    "Presumably that's the number of cards in the set. But that seems to include basic lands, which are numbered 272-291 including all the different printings. So this number is only roughly meaningful. At least it doesn't include alternate art styles, which would inflate the number to 426. The real number of unique cards in the set, including the 5 basic lands, is 276. The difference comes from the fact that each land has 4 different styles. Most sets are going to have some extra styles for each basic land, so I think this number is useful even if it's not a precise count of the number of unique cards.\n",

In this case, 63/64 packs have the first distribution, and 1/64 packs have a Special Guest instead of one of the commons. So this just saves having to add together the weights of the different booster distributions.\n",

It might not be important because it has been consistently about a dozen cards in each set.\n",

Cards like Mishra, Lost to Phyrexia don't have a casting cost because they are played by melding two DFCs, each of which has half the melded card. That makes it tricky to decide whether to include the melded cards in analyses. For example, if I am interested in how many cards a set includes with a certain color identity, do I include the melded cards or not? I'm leaning towards no, because each melded card is the combined reverse faces of two other cards.

So Brutal Cathar is not a red permanent for the purposes of triggering Ajani, Nacatl Avenger, but Moonrage Brute is. And when Brutal Cathar is on the stack, it can't be targeted by a card that targets red spells. Since I've decided to treat each DFC as a single card for most analyses, neither colorIdentity nor colorIndicator is going to work perfectly for color distribution analysis. I might need to put together casting cost and color Indicator...\n",

    "Okay, they've got it, too, and as expected, the transformed face has a mana value of 0. So all DFCs and double cards are duplicated per side. This complicates my decision to treat these cases as one card. If it's safe to assume that the front comes first (and I can always shore that up with a string comparison to the beginning of 'name'), a card can be constructed by taking the name from the first half... The more I think about this, the more dissatisfied I am with the Scryfall style. But there are problems with the other approach, too: it leads to incorrect calculation of the number of unique cards in the set, which is relevant for color distribution. I guess each approach has its virtues for different questions, so I should be prepared to use both approaches. For some questions, I can use the data as it as, for others I need to flatten it.\n",

    "Interesting that there aren't two mana values for Riling Dawnbreaker // Signaling Roar. I thought it would be like a split card, where the mana value is the sum of the costs of both halves. It's more like a card with an adventure, obviously. So the mana value is based on the cost of the \"main\" part of the card, but it can have a different mana value on the stack.\n",

    "Ironically enough, the number is a string. That's because it can actually contain letters and even symbols representing promotional qualities. That means I can't always use my trick of avoiding alternates by restricting analysis to card with numbers lower than the baseSetSize because comparison will fail if the card's number has letters or symbols in it.\n",
