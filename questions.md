* Has the number of cards that break deckbuilding rules increased over time?
* I'm interested in trends in the style, tone, length, and syntactical complexity of the flavor text, and questions like whether the qualities of the flavor text correlate with the saltiness of the card.
* How has the number of Planeswalkers in each set changed since their introduction?
* Has the distribution of artists in each set changed over time, tending toward fewer cards per artist? This would be interesting to look at both including and excluding the alternate art cards (but not alternate styles with the same art).
* How far back in time do you have to go before you start finding content problems (that Hasbro has acknowledged)?
* Has the typical number of planeswalkers per set changed since they were introduced? Their typical starting loyalty?
